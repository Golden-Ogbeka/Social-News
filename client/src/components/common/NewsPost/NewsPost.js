					There can only be a stable state when there is no crime.
					Crime puts fear, despair and anger in the citizens of a
					community thereby making it virutally impossible to conduct
					tasks and therefore affects the economic activities of the
					state. To allow the free flow of state affairs, chrimes must
					be brought to justice as soon as possible and the entire
